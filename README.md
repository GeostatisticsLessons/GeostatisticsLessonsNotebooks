# Geostatistics Lessons Notebooks

[Geostatistics Lessons](http://geostatisticslessons.com/) is an open disclosure of some guidance in geostatistical modeling. These Python notebooks and data are prepared by Lesson authors and associated contributors to supplement the Lessons. As new Lessons are authored and notebooks created, this repository will be updated.

## Lessons

Lessons with notebooks and data available include:

* An Application of Bayes Theorem to Geostatistical Mapping ([notebook](notebooks/bayesmapping/bayesmapping.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/bayesmapping)), Jared Deutsch and Clayton Deutsch, 2018
* Multidimensional Scaling ([notebook](notebooks/mds/mds.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/mds)), Steven Mancell and Clayton Deutsch, 2019
* Collocated Cokriging ([notebook](notebooks/collocatedcokriging/collocatedcokriging.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/collocatedcokriging)), Matthew Samson and Clayton Deutsch, 2020
* The Nugget Effect ([notebook](notebooks/nuggeteffect/nuggeteffect.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/nuggeteffect)), Eric Daniels and Diogo Silva, 2024
* The Pairwise Relative Variogram ([notebook](notebooks/pairwiserelative/pairwiserelative.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/pairwiserelative)), Haoze Zhang and Ryan Barnett, 2024
* Introduction to Choosing a Kriging Plan ([notebook](notebooks/introkrigingplan/introkrigingplan.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/introkrigingplan)), James Eke and Ryan Barnett, 2024

## Dependencies

Notebooks are implemented in Python 3 using the scientific python stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, ...). Refer to the individual notebooks for any particular dependencies.

Some notebooks leverage the Resource Modeling Solutions Platform ([RMSP](https://resourcemodelingsolutions.com/rmsp)), a geostatistical modeling package that provides commercial and academic licenses. These notebooks augment the Lesson, but the interested reader is free to implement in any geostatistical modeling software they are interested in using.

## License

Notebooks are licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE) license separately from the Lessons. Refer to [Geostatistics Lessons](http://geostatisticslessons.com/) for licensing information on the Lessons.
